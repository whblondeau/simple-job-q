priority-q README
----
This directory is precisely like the wait-q directory in behavior,
content, and operations. The only difference is, the Monitor will process
wait-q UOWs _only_ if the priority-q is empty.

NOTE: the priority-q should be used only when the need is real. The
large majority of UOWs should enter the system via wait-q and not via
priority-q. THIS QUEUE IS FOR EXCEPTIONAL CASES.
