fail-q README
----
This queue holds jobs that did not complete:

    - they failed to terminated normally, or

    - they encountered problems, internal or external, that would
        prevent them from ever being able to perform their job.

The Monitor places the UOW files into this queue when they are found in
the currently_executing folder after a crash or system halt, or after
the OS or a human operator has halted a hung state or a nonterminating loop. 

The Monitor does nothing further with failed UOWs except
to report their presence periodically.
