done-q README

This queue holds jobs that have successfully completed:

    - they terminated normally

    - they did not report an error condition that would contraindicate
        "success" as an end state.

The Monitor places the UOW files into this queue when they are found in
the currently_executing folder, when no flagged process is running,
with evidence of successful completion.

The Monitor does nothing further with successfully completed UOWs except
to report their presence periodically.
