done-q README
----
This queue holds jobs that have UNsuccessfully completed:

    - they terminated normally

    - they DID report an error condition that would contraindicate
        "success" as an end state.

The Monitor places the UOW files into this queue when they are found in
the currently_executing folder, when no flagged process is running, 
with evidence of unsuccessful completion.

The Monitor does nothing further with error-completed UOWs except
to report their presence periodically.

Retry of Error-completed UOWs is never done automatically. A human
needs to move the UOW (or a suitably modified copy) to wait-q or priority-q.
