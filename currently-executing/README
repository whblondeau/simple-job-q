currently-executing README
----
This directory holds (besides this README which should remain in place):

At most a single UOW. The UOW is a file correlated with a job to execute.
The UOW can be in one of three states:

    - Emplaced but not yet started (the process to be run according to the 
        UOW's information has not yet been started)

    - Started but not completed (the process is still executing)

    - Finished (The process is no longer running, whether because it completed
        normally, crashed, or was killed by the OS on behalf of a user or of
        the logic built into the Monitor.)

A UOW should be deposited by the Monitor, and removed by the Monitor. 
Human intervention is not recommended.
