----
This directory holds zero or more UOWs (Units of Work) and imposes an
ordering upon them. The ordering is defined by a timestamp written in
integer seconds since the epoch. The Monitor prepends the timestamp on the
UOW when it encounters an unstamped UOW. If there are multiple unstamped
UOWs, the Monitor will append a hyphen and an ordinal number, observing 
System file stats as possible when ordering the additional number.

This ordering applies to the order in which the UOWs will be executed.
